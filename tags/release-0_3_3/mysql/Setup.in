# If you have dynamic MySQL libraries, they will need to be on your
# LD_LIBRARY_PATH at runtime. But you are probably better off linking
# against the static mysqlclient library. If the above line doesn't work
# for you (it works for me with the standard MySQL RPMs), try this:
#_mysql _mysqlmodule.c -I/usr/include/mysql /usr/lib/mysql/libmysqlclient.a -lz

# Uncomment for Windows
#_mysql _mysqlmodule.c -L/mysql/lib/opt -I/mysql/include -lmysqlclient -lwsock32
