Z MySQL DA Releases

  2.0.6

    This version finally should have all the transaction support
    working correctly. If your MySQL server supports transactions,
    i.e. it has at least one transaction-safe table (TST) handler,
    transactions are enabled automatically. If transactions are
    enabled, rollbacks (aborts) fail if any non-TST tables were
    modified.

  2.0.5

    Transactions don't really work right in this and prior versions.


  2.0.4

    INT columns, whether UNSIGNED or not, are returned as Python
    long integers to avoid overflows. Python-1.5.2 adds an 'L' to
    the end of long integers when printing. Later versions do not.
    As a workaround, use affected columns with a format string,
    i.e. '<dtml-var x fmt="%d">'.

  2.0.0

    This is the first version of the database adapter using MySQLdb
    for Zope.  This database adapter is based on the Z DCOracle DA
    version 2.2.0.
