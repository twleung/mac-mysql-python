Prerequisites:

Python 1.5.2 or higher
-- http://www.pythonlabs.com/products/python2.0/download_python2.0.html
-- http://www.python.org/1.6/
-- http://www.python.org/1.5/
-- Versions lower than 1.5.2 WON'T WORK.
-- If you have Red Hat Linux or a similar packaging system, make sure
   you have the Python development headers and libraries (python-devel).

Distutils 1.0 or higher
-- comes with Python 1.6 and 2.0
-- http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/download.html

MySQL 3.22.19 or higher
-- http://www.mysql.com/downloads/
-- Versions lower than 3.22 definitely WON'T WORK.
-- Versions lower than 3.22.19 might not work.
-- The current (recommended) 3.22 release is 3.22.32.
-- MySQL-3.23 is beta at present but supported.
-- If you have Red Hat Linux or a similar packaging system, make sure
   you have the MySQL development headers and libraries (MySQL-devel).

First thing to do is edit setup.py. There are some variables towards the
beginning that tell it where your MySQL include files and libraries are.
The values are right for MySQL's standard Red Hat Linux (6.2) RPMs. If
you have another platform, you'll have to figure out the right values
yourself.

Note that recent binary distributions include two sets of client
libraries: mysqlclient and mysqlclient_r. The latter are the
"thread-safe" libraries, so use those if you can, and if threading is
important to you.

If you have the dynamic client libraries (on Linux, .so vs. .a), those
will be used by default. If they are not on your standard loader path,
you will have to set or adjust the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable
(on Linux) or whatever your platform requires. Otherwise, you can adjust
setup.py to link against the static library.

Finally, putting it together:

$ python setup.py build
# python setup.py install

If you prefer RPMs, you can use the bdist_rpm command with setup.py.

Thanks go to Brian Fordham for cooking up an early version of setup.py.
