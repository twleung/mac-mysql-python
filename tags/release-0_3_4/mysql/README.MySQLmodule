If you have code that uses the old MySQLmodule's Mysqldb interface,
try CompatMysqldb. It is the old module adapted to use _mysql instead
of MySQL[module]. The original Mysqldb was written by James Henstridge.
If it's broken, it's probably my fault: I haven't tested it very much.
Consider it experimental.
