Description: Python interface to MySQL-3.23
        
        MySQLdb is an interface to the popular MySQL database server for Python.
        The design goals are:
        
        -     Compliance with Python database API version 2.0
        -     Thread-safety
        -     Thread-friendliness (threads will not block each other)
        -     Compatibility with MySQL-3.23 and later
        
        This module should be mostly compatible with an older interface
        written by Joe Skinner and others. However, the older version is
        a) not thread-friendly, b) written for MySQL 3.21, c) apparently
        not actively maintained. No code from that version is used in
        MySQLdb. MySQLdb is free software.
