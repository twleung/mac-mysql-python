** Warning **

As of MySQL-python version 1.2.2 there is a bug if you use unicode set the
database to use a binary (*_bin) collation (eg. utf8_bin). With a binary
collation it won't return the data correctly from the database. That is it
won't return it as unicode, instead always as bytestrings.

Bug #1693363 if you want to check the status.

https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1693363&group_id=22307&atid=374932

The only workaround is to not use a binary collation.

If you are curious about why you'd want use a binary collation, it is to allow
for case insensitive searching.
