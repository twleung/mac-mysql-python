ZMySQLDA 3.0alpha1

Initial release of an extensively reworked Zope adapter. This is an alpha
release due to the limited testing it has so far undergone and that there are a
couple areas that could probably use a bit more attention. 

If you test this release and find any problems please file bugs in the sf.net
tracker [1]. The roadmap to a stable release depends on the feedback I get on
this (and following) releases. Without feedback it will depend on my and my
company's schedule for testing.
