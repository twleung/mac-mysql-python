  Installation

    The Z MySQL database adapter uses the MySQLdb package.  
    This must be installed before you can use the Z MySQL DA.
    You can find this at::

        http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python

    You need at least version 1.0.0; 1.2.0 is recommended. If you are
    compiling this yourself, you must use the same python executable
    as your Zope installation uses, otherwise Zope will not find it.

  Connection Strings
  
    The connection string used for Z MySQL Database Connection
    are of the form::

       database[@host[:port]] [user [password [unix_socket]]]

    or typically just::

       database user password

    to use the default server.
