Z MySQL DA Releases

  3.0alpha4

    Fixed pernicious corner case bug with joining a transaction after the
    transaction has started and been aborted.
    Zope dependency raised to Zope-2.8 or newer.

  3.0alpha3

    Unicode support now works!
    Unicode support reworked to use MySQLdb's unicode support instead of its
        own half-baked layer.
    Minor cleanups and extensions to database introspection methods.
    Minor cleanups/fixes to dtml.
    Removed a few unnecessary thread locks.
    Changed failed query logging entries from errors to warnings.
    

  3.0alpha2

    Moved DBPool instantiation from factory() to connect() to better facilitate
    API backwards compatibility.

    Changed all default values on keyword aruments for the auto create db
    feature. They all now default to True.

    Left in a bit of debugging code that disabled the new create_db
    functionality. Removed it.

  3.0alpha1

    Note that there are some changes in the internal API. So if you have
    subclassed you should double check compatibility.

    Features:

    Experimental Unicode support has been added. It is hardcoded to UTF-8 and
    has had limited testing at this point. Adapted from patches made by Graeme
    Mathieson.

    New optional feature of automatically creating the database provided in the
    connection string. The mysql 'user' used for the connection must have
    CREATE permission. It defaults to on to encourage more testing.

    Database connection not created until first use instead of when the 
    object is first loaded. Ie. connection created at connect() call instead
    of __setstate__() call. This helps conserve system resources and makes
    debugging connection issues a bit easier. It is also needed for the new
    db pool implementation (see below).

    Bugs:
    
    Automatically reopens connections closed by client timeouts.

    Fixed major deadlock causing bug that can occur with versions of Zope 
    greater than 2.8. It was caused by the use of the volatile attribute 
    (_v_) to keep the reference to the existing connection. Volatile
    attributes can go away mid-transaction which would cause a deadlock when
    used with a transactional engine (eg. innodb). The fix involves a fixed
    pool of adapters and db connections. This also allowed for the elimination
    of many of the locks. Adapted from patches made by Vincent Pelletier.

    #670137:  missing sortKey() fixed in Zope
    #814378:  infinite reconnect recursion fixed
    #1560557: missing import
    #1242842: missing MULTI_STATEMENTS
    #1226690: missing close() method


  2.0.9

    Allow the connection string to work without a specified database.

    Wrap queries with a lock to prevent multiple threads from using
    the connection simultaneously (this may or may not be happening).
    If transactional, then there is an additional transaction lock,
    acquired at the beginning of the transaction and released when
    either finished or aborted.

    A named lock can be specified by inserting *LOCKNAME at the start
    of the connection string. This is probably best used only if you
    must use non-transactional tables.

    Some stuff will be logged as an error when bad things happen
    during the transaction manager hooks.

  2.0.8

    More information about columns is available from the table
    browser. This is primarily to support SQL Blender.

    DECIMAL and NUMERIC columns now returned as floating-point numbers
    (was string). This has also been fixed in MySQLdb-0.9.1, but the
    fix is included here just in case you don't upgrade. Upgrading is
    a good idea anyway, because some memory-related bugs are fixed,
    particularly if using Zope 2.4 and Python 2.1.

  2.0.7

    Transaction support tweaked some more. A plus (+) or minus (-)
    at the beginning of the connection string will force transactions
    on or off respectively. By default, transactions are enabled if
    the server supports them. Beware: If you are using non-TST tables
    on a server that supports transactions, you should probably force
    transactions off.

  2.0.6

    This version finally should have all the transaction support
    working correctly. If your MySQL server supports transactions,
    i.e. it has at least one transaction-safe table (TST) handler,
    transactions are enabled automatically. If transactions are
    enabled, rollbacks (aborts) fail if any non-TST tables were
    modified.

  2.0.5

    Transactions don't really work right in this and prior versions.

  2.0.4

    INT columns, whether UNSIGNED or not, are returned as Python
    long integers to avoid overflows. Python-1.5.2 adds an 'L' to
    the end of long integers when printing. Later versions do not.
    As a workaround, use affected columns with a format string,
    i.e. '<dtml-var x fmt="%d">'.

  2.0.0

    This is the first version of the database adapter using MySQLdb
    for Zope.  This database adapter is based on the Z DCOracle DA
    version 2.2.0.
