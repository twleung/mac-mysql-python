=====================
 What's new in 1.2.1
=====================

Switched to Subversion. Was going to do this for 1.3, but a
SourceForge CVS outage has forced the issue.

Mapped a lot of new 4.1 and 5.0 error codes to Python exceptions

Added an API call for mysql_set_character_set(charset) (MySQL > 5.0.7)

Added an API call for mysql_get_character_set_info() (MySQL > 5.0.10)

Revamped the build system. Edit site.cfg if necessary (probably not
in most cases)

Python-2.3 is now the minimum version.

Dropped support for mx.Datetime and stringtimes; always uses Python
datetime module now.

Improved unit tests

New connect() options:
* charset: sets character set, implies use_unicode
* sql_mode: sets SQL mode (i.e. ANSI, etc.; see MySQL docs)

When using MySQL-4.1 or newer, enables MULTI_STATEMENTS

When using MySQL-5.0 or newer, enables MULTI_RESULTS

When using MySQL-4.1 or newer, more detailed warning messages
are produced

SET columns returned as Python Set types; you can pass a Set as
a parameter to cursor.execute().

Support for the new MySQL-5.0 DECIMAL implementation

Support for Python Decimal type

Some use of weak references internally. Cursors no longer leak
if you don't close them. Connections still do, unfortunately.

ursor.fetchXXXDict() methods raise DeprecationWarning

cursor.begin() is making a brief reappearence.

cursor.callproc() now works, with some limitations.
