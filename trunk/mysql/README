Python-2.0:

Edit setup.py and make sure the paths are right for your system. This
uses Distutils, so it should work on all platforms.

$ python setup.py build
# python setup.py install

Python-1.6:

The previous method should work, else use the classic method.

Python-1.5.2:

Get Distutils from www.pythonlabs.com and install it. Then do as above.
Else, use the classic method.

Classic method:

Check Setup.in and make sure it has the right paths for your system.

To build:	python build.py
To install: 	follow additional instructions after build.

Got windows? Try compile.py instead.
