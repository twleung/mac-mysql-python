<title>MySQLdb: a Python interface for MySQL
<author>Andy Dustman
<date>$Id$

<abstract>MySQLdb is an thread-compatible interface to the popular
MySQL database server that provides the Python database API.

<sect>Introduction 

<P>This module should be <ref id="MySQLmodule" name="mostly compatible">
with an older interface
written by Joe Skinner and others. However, the older version is a)
not thread-friendly (database operations could cause all other threads
to block), b) written for MySQL 3.21 (does not compile against newer
versions without patches), c) apparently not actively
maintained. MySQLdb is a completely new module, distributed free of
charge under a license derived from the Python license.

<p>
<sect1>Platforms
<p>
<sect2>Linux/UNIX
<p>
This module is developed on RedHat Linux 5.2 for Intel. It should build without
much trouble on most UNIX-like platforms by using the <tt/build.py/ script.
<sect2>Windows (3.11, 95, 98, NT, 2000, CE, BSOD, XYZ, etc.)
<p>
Windows is <em/not/ a supported platform. 
However, the <tt/compile.py/ script
reportedly gets the job done, probably just on NT, maybe others.
<sect1>Python
<p>
MySQLdb requires Python 1.5.2. Earlier versions will not work, because
support for C <tt/long long/ is required by MySQL.  If you have an
earlier version of Python, upgrade to 1.5.2 or beyond.

<sect1>MySQL
<p>
<sect2>MySQL-3.22
<p>
Only versions 3.22.32 and
up are guaranteed to work. Some older versions may work;
if you have an older version you should
seriously consider upgrading to get the bug fixes and particularly
the security updates.

MySQL-3.22 seems to have a strange bug when handling TIME
columns. For this reason, there is presently no type converter for
TIME columns (the value is returned as a string). If you want to
experiment with this, the code which actives the type converter can be
easily commented in.

<sect2>MySQL-3.23
<p>
MySQLdb has only been lightly tested.
MySQL-3.23 is presently in alpha (unstable) release. Several API
additions have been made so far. These will be incorporated into
MySQLdb as work progresses.

<sect1>DateTime
<p>If you have the <htmlurl
url="http://starship.skyport.net/~lemburg/mxDateTime.html"
name="DateTime"> module installed (recommended), MySQLdb will use
it for date-related objects. Otherwise, these will be returned to
Python as strings. You can also modify the type conversion
dictionaries to return these as other object classes, if you
prefer.

<sect1>MySQLmodule<label id="MySQLmodule">
<p>
MySQLmodule, the older MySQL interface by Joe Skinner and others,
 is also a split C/Python
interface. <tt/MySQL/, the C portion, has an interface similar to
perl's DBI internally. In addition, there is Python portion, <tt/Mysqldb/,
which provides a DB API v1.0 interface, written by James Henstridge.

In contrast, MySQLdb's C portion, <tt><ref id="_mysql"></tt>, is designed
to mimic the MySQL C API in an object-oriented way; you should not
expect to move from <tt/MySQL/ to <tt/_mysql/ without a fair amount of
work. <tt><ref id="MySQLdb"></tt> provides a DB API v2.0 interface,
which has some changes from the v1.0 interface. Things to watch out
for in particular:

<table>
<tabular ca="foo">
Operation | Mysqldb | MySQLdb
@ Connecting | <tt>db = Mysqldb.Mysqldb("db@host user pass")</tt>
| <tt>db = MySQLdb.connect(db='db', host='host', user='user', passwd='pass')</tt>
@ Implicit cursor | <tt>db.execute(SQL)</tt> |
implicit cursors dropped from DB API v2.0; always use <tt>c = db.cursor()</tt>
@ Fetch row as dictionary | <tt>c.fetchDict()</tt>,
keys are "<em/table.column/" |
not standard; <tt>MySQLDict.py</tt> provides a dictionary interface,
keys are "<em/column/"; use SQL <tt/AS/ to rename fields.
@ Transactions | <tt>db.commit()</tt> and <tt>db.rollback()</tt>
both exist and silently do nothing <ref id="rollback" name="(danger!)">
| <tt>db.commit()</tt> and <tt>db.rollback()</tt> work if the MySQL
client library can perform transactions; otherwise <tt>db.rollback()</tt>
is not defined
<caption>Mysqldb to MySQLdb changes</tabular></table>

<sect1>Zope and ZMySQLDA
<p>The distribution contains a patch to modify the
<htmlurl url="http://www.zope.org/" name="Zope">
<htmlurl url="http://www.zope.org/Members/MikeP/ZMySQLDA" name="ZMySQLDA">
to use MySQLdb instead of MySQLmodule. Read the instructions in
the patch. If that fails, read the FAQ.
<sect1>Documentation
<p>The web page documentation may be slightly ahead of the latest release
and may reflect features of the next release.
<sect1>FAQs
<p>A FAQ is available at
<htmlurl url="http://starship.python.net/crew/adustman/MySQLdb-FAQ.html">.
<sect>_mysql module<label id="_mysql">
<P>
If you want to write applications which are portable across databases,
avoid using this module directly. <tt>_mysql</tt> provides an
interface which mostly implements the MySQL C API. For more
information, see the MySQL documentation. The documentation for this
module is intentionally weak because you probably should use the
higher-level <ref id="MySQLdb"> module. If you really need it, use the
standard MySQL docs and transliterate as necessary.
<p>
The C API has been wrapped in an object-oriented way. The only MySQL
data structures which are implemented are the <tt>MYSQL</tt> (database
connection handle) and <tt>MYSQL_RES</tt> (result handle) types. In
general, any function which takes <tt>MYSQL *mysql</tt> as an argument
is now a method of the connection object, and any function which takes
<tt>MYSQL_RES *result</tt> as an argument is a method of the result
object. Functions requiring none of the MySQL data structures are
implemented as functions in the module. Functions requiring one of the
other MySQL data structures are generally not implemented.  Deprecated
functions are not implemented. In all cases, the <tt>mysql_</tt>
prefix is dropped from the name. Most of the <tt>conn</tt> methods
listed are also available as MySQLdb Connection object methods. Their
use is explicitly non-portable.

<sect>MySQLdb -- DB API interface<label id="MySQLdb">
<p>
MySQLdb is a thin Python wrapper around <tt><ref id="_mysql"></tt>
which makes it compatible with the Python DB API interface (version
2).  In reality, a fair amount of the code which implements the API is
in <tt>_mysql</tt> for the sake of efficiency.
<p>
The DB API specification should be your primary guide for using this
module. Only deviations from the spec and other database-dependent
things will be documented here. Note that all symbols from
<tt>_mysql</tt> are imported into this module.  Mostly these are the
required exceptions, the constant classes, and a very few functions.
<sect1>Functions and attributes <P>Only a few top-level functions and
attributes are defined within MySQLdb.

<descrip>
<tag><label id="connect()">connect(parameters...)</tag> Constructor
      for creating a connection to the database. Returns a Connection
      Object. Parameters are the same as for the MySQL C API. Note
      that all parameters must be specified as keyword arguments! The
      default value for each parameter is NULL or zero, as
      appropriate. Consult the MySQL documentation for more
      details. The important parameters are:

<descrip>
      <tag>host</tag> 
            name of host to connect to. Default: use local host 

      <tag>user</tag> 
            user to authenticate as. Default: current effective user.

      <tag>passwd</tag> 
            password to authenticate with. Default: no password.

      <tag>db</tag> 
            database to use. Default: no default database.

      <tag>conv</tag> literal-to-Python type conversion dictionary.
            Default: empty dictionary, no type conversion.

      <tag>quote_conv</tag> Python type-to-literal conversion
            dictionary Default: empty dictionary, no type conversion.

<tag>unix_pipe</tag>
	location of UNIX socket. Default: use TCP.

<tag>port</tag>
	TCP port of MySQL server. Default: standard port (3306).
</descrip>

<tag>apilevel</tag> 
      String constant stating the supported DB API level. '2.0'

<tag>threadsafety</tag> Integer constant stating the level of thread
      safety the interface supports. Set to 1, which means: Threads
      may share the module, but not connections. This is the practice
      recommended by the MySQL documentation. However, it should be
      safe to share a connection between two threads provided only one
      thread at a time uses it (i.e. a mutex is employed). Note that
      this is only safe if the threads are using. mysql_store_result()
      as opposed to mysql_use_result(). The latter is not recommended
      for threaded applications. See the MySQL documentation for more
      details.

<tag>paramstyle</tag> String constant stating the type of parameter
      marker formatting expected by the interface. Set to 'format' =
      ANSI C printf format codes, e.g. '...WHERE name=%s'. If a
      mapping object is used for conn.execute(), then the interface
      actually uses 'pyformat' = Python extended format codes,
      e.g. '...WHERE name=%(name)s'. However, the API does not
      presently allow the specification of more than one style in
      paramstyle.

      Compatibility note: The older MySQLmodule uses a similar
      parameter scheme, but requires that quotes be placed around
      format strings which will contain strings, dates, and similar
      character data. This is not necessary for MySQLdb. It is
      recommended that %s (and not '%s') be used for all parameters,
      regardless of type. The interface performs all necessary
      quoting.

<tag><label id="type_conv">type_conv</tag> A dictionary mapping MySQL
      types (from <TT>FIELD_TYPE.*</TT>) to callable Python objects
      (usually functions) which convert from a string to the desired
      type. This is initialized with reasonable defaults for most
      types. When creating a Connection object, you can pass your own
      type converter dictionary as a keyword parameter. Otherwise, it
      uses a copy of <tt>type_conv</tt> which is safe to modify on a
      per-connection basis. The dictionary includes some of the
      factory functions from the <tt>DateTime</tt> module, if it is
      available. Several non-standard types (<tt>SET, ENUM</tt>) are
      returned as strings, which is how MySQL returns all
      columns. Note: <tt>TIME</tt> columns are returned as strings
      presently. This should be a temporary condition.

<tag><label id="quote_conv">quote_conv</tag> A dictionary mapping
      Python types (from the standard <tt>types</tt> module or
      built-in function <tt>type()</tt> to MySQL literals.  By
      default, the value is treated as a string. When creating a
      Connection object, you can pass your own quote converter
      dictionary as a keyword parameter.

</descrip>

<sect1>Connection Objects
<P>Connection objects are returned by the <tt>connect()</tt> function.
<descrip>
<tag>commit()</tag> If the database supports transactions, this
      commits the current transaction; otherwise this method
      successfully does nothing.  <footnote>MySQL does not presently
      support transactions.</footnote> 

<tag><label id="rollback">rollback()</tag> If the
      database supports transactions, this rolls back (cancels) the
      current transaction; otherwise a <tt>NotSupportedError</tt> is
      raised.  This method is only defined if the MySQL client library
      supports transactions.

Compatibility note: The older <ref id="MySQLmodule"> does define this method,
      which sucessfully does nothing. This is dangerous behavior, as a
      successful rollback indicates that the current transaction was
      backed out, which is not true, and fails to notify the
      programmer that the database now needs to be cleaned up by other
      means.

<tag>cursor(parameters...)</tag> 
      MySQL does not support cursors; however, cursors are easily emulated.
</descrip>

<sect1>Cursor Objects
<P>Cursor objects support an optional argument
<tt>name</tt>, which is pretty useless.  While it is possible to
create Cursor objects with the class constructor, this is not
recommended.
<p>
<descrip>
<tag>callproc()</tag>
      Not implemented.

<tag>nextset()</tag>
      Not implemented.

<tag>setinputsizes()</tag>
      Does nothing, successfully.

<tag>setoutputsizes()</tag>
      Does nothing, successfully.

<tag><label id="executeXXX()">execute(query[,parameters]></tag>

<tag>executemany(query,[,parameters])</tag> These methods work as
      described in the API. The parameters are converted according to
      the <ref id="quote_conv"> dictionary (see above).  By default,
      <tt>str()</tt> is used as the conversion function. This presents
      a problem for the various date and time columns:
      <tt>__str__</tt> for <tt>DateTime</tt> objects includes
      fractional seconds, which MySQL (up to 3.22.32, at least),
      considers illegal input, and so zeros the field. This may be
      fixed in later MySQL releases.

<tag>fetchone()</tag>

<tag>fetchmany([n])</tag>

<tag>fetchall()</tag>
      These methods work as described in the API.

<tag>format_DATE(d)</tag>

<tag>format_TIME(d)</tag>

<tag>format_TIMESTAMP(d)</tag> These functions all take a DateTime
      object as input and return an appropriately formatted
      string. They are intended for use with the <tt><ref
      id="executeXXX()"></tt> methods.

</descrip>
<sect>Using and extending

<P>In general, it is probably wise to not directly interact with the
DB API except for small applicatons. Databases, even SQL databases,
vary widely in capabilities and may have non-standard features. The DB
API does a good job of providing a reasonably portable interface but
some methods are non-portable. Specifically, the parameters accepted
by <tt><ref id="connect()"></tt> are completely implementation-dependent.

If you believe your application may need to run on several different
databases, the author recommends the following approach, based on
personal experience: Write a simplified API for your application which
implements the specific queries and operations your application needs
to perform. Implement this API as a base class which should be have
few database dependencies, and then derive a subclass from this which
implements the necessary dependencies. In this way, porting your
application to a new database should be a relatively simple matter of
creating a new subclass, assuming the new database is reasonably
standard.

For an example of this, see the author's
<htmlurl url="http://starship.python.net/crew/adustman"
name="SQLDict module">, which allows standard queries to be
defined and accessed using an object which looks like a
dictionary, and reads/writes user-defined objects.

Because MySQLdb's Connection and Cursor objects are written in Python,
you can easily derive your own subclasses. There are several Cursor
classes in MySQLdb:
<p>
<descrip>
<tag>CursorBase</tag> The base class for Cursor objects.

<tag>CursorWarningMixIn</tag> Causes the Warning exception to be raised
on queries which produce warnings.

<tag>CursorStoreResultMixIn</tag> Causes the Cursor to use the
<tt>mysql_store_result()</tt> function to get the query result. The
entire result set is stored on the client side.

<tag>CursorUseResultMixIn</tag> Causes the cursor to use the
<tt>mysql_use_result()</tt> function to get the query result. The
result set is stored on the server side and is transferred row by row
using fetch operations. Not recommended, particularly for threaded
applications.

<tag>CursorTupleRowsMixIn</tag> Causes the cursor to return rows
as a tuple of the column values.

<tag>CursorDictRowsMixIn</tag> Causes the cursor to return rows
as a dictionary, where the keys are column names and the values
are column values. Note that if the column names are not unique,
some of them will be overwritten. This can be avoided by using
the SQL <tt>AS</TT> keyword. (This is yet-another reason not to use
<tt/*/ in SQL queries, particularly where <tt/JOIN/ is involved.

<tag>Cursor</tag> The default cursor class. This class is composed
of <tt>CursorWarningMixIn, CursorStoreResultMixIn, CursorTupleRowsMixIn,</tt>
and <tt>BaseCursor</tt>, i.e. it raises <tt>Warning</tt>, uses
<tt>mysql_store_result()</tt>, and returns rows as tuples.
</descrip>
<p>For an example of how to use these classes, take a look at the
<tt>MySQLDict</tt> module, which comes with MySQLdb.
This operates as above, except that it
returns rows as dictionaries.
